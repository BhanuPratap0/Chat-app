# Chat-app

Welcome to *Talk-A-Tive*, a real-time chat application where users can connect and communicate instantly. This project is my personal venture into the world of MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack development, enhanced with real-time messaging functionality through Socket.io.

## Live Demo

```
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
```
# Backend dependencies
npm install

# Frontend dependencies
cd client
npm install
```
3. Set up your MongoDB database and obtain your connection string.
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string as follows:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```
5. Start the server:
```
npm start
```
6. Navigate to `client` directory and start the React app:
